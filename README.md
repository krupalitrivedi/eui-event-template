## Happy Hacktoberfest!!

_I remember my first Hacktoberfest so clearly because I was so intimidated by Git and contributing code to other repos, and I was still VERY early in my coding journey and didn't even know how to code, but enjoyed the experience so much!_

_Hacktoberfest holds a special place in my heart because it's a great way to get started into coding and comfortable with Github. I'm so excited to finally maintain a repo that I can help others experience the same joy I did!_

Want to participate in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)? All you have to do is sign up, and then successfully merge 4 pull requests in the month of October! Check out our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/brittanyjoiner15/eui-event/blob/main/contributing.md) and [open issues](https://github.com/brittanyjoiner15/eui-event) to participate from this repo!

# React + Eui Template for An Event Website

This is a template for an event based website. The website was created for an event my ERG is hosting ([Rainbow Stack Summit](https://www.rainbowstacksummit.com/)), but I decided to make its repository so others could contribute to it and use it as well!

This is all very much Work In Progress, so if you have any comments or ideas, or want to contribute, feel free to create an issue.

## Demo

## Connect Google Sheets with your app

Follow these steps to connect your google sheets file with the app.

- **Create a google sheet**
 1. Go to https://docs.google.com/ and create a blank sheet
 2. Add name, title, team, location, shortBio, pronouns, imageLink headers in the sheet (make sure the order of headers is same as in the example sheet provided below).
 3. Populate the sheet with some data.
    ``` 
    Data Schema
    name : string
    title: string
    team: string
    location: string
    shortBio: string
    pronouns: string
    imageLink: string (url of hosted image)
    ```
  4. Change the sheet name to "Speakers" (Sheet name "Speakers" is case sensitive).

- **Deploy App Script Web App**
 1. Open your google sheet.
 2. Click on Extensions tab.
 3. Click on App Script.

 4. Delete all the code from the editor (inside Code.gs file).
```
        function doGet(req) {
            if(req.parameters.sheetName == "Speakers") {
                return getSpeakersData()
            }
        }

        function getSpeakersData() {
        var doc = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet()
        var sheet = doc.getSheetByName("Speakers")
        var values = sheet.getDataRange().getValues()
        
        var output = []
        for(var i=1; i<values.length; i++) {
            var row = {}
            row['name'] = values[i][0]
            row['title'] = values[i][1]
            row['team'] = values[i][2]
            row['location'] = values[i][3]
            row['shortBio'] = values[i][4]
            row['pronouns'] = values[i][5]
            row['imageLink'] = values[i][6]

            output.push(row)
        }

            return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({speakers: output})).setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON)
        }
        
 ```
        
5. Paste above code in the Code.gs file.
6. Click on Deploy button and select New Deployment.

7. Click on settings icon on select type menu and select web app. 

![](https://i.postimg.cc/jjW3jRmj/Deployment-settings.jpg)

8. Add Description.
9. Select Anyone in who has access section and click deploy.
10. Authorize access. 
 Google might say it's an unverified app and tell you to go back to safety its because the app that you are creating will have access to your sheet data but since you are developing the application so essentially you are accessing your data only, which is totally safe. 
11. Copy the Web URL.
 Make sure you **do not share the Web URL** with anyone else because if you do so then that person can access your data.

- **Configure local project**

1. Open project folder, go to src/utilities/env.js
2. Replace the string webAppUrl with the Web URL you copied.

3. Refresh the speakers page to see the results.
